# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m openapi_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/dsayling8/ZoomFoodToo/1.0.0/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/dsayling8/ZoomFoodToo/1.0.0/openapi.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t openapi_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 openapi_server
```

Simply navigate to your browser as descrbed above.

## Swagger Editor

You can also start up the swagger editor with the local spec file.

When you're done editing the file though, you'll have to download it from the browser and replace the `zoomfood-openapi.yml` in the project directory.

```bash
docker run -p 8081:8080 -v $(pwd):/tmp -e SWAGGER_FILE=/tmp/zoomfood-openapi.yaml swaggerapi/swagger-editor
```
